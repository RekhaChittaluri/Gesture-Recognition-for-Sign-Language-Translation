# Gesture-Recognition-for-Sign-Language-Translation[Machine Learning]
Minar Project

This project focuses on building a real-time **gesture recognition system** that translates **American Sign Language (ASL)** into textual output, aimed at bridging the communication gap for the hearing and speech-impaired community.


## 💡 Project Overview
- Implemented a **machine learning-based sign language recognition system** capable of detecting hand gestures and translating them in real-time.
- Achieved **90% classification accuracy** using a **Random Forest model** trained on a diverse ASL gesture dataset.
- Integrated **OpenCV and MediaPipe** for **real-time hand tracking and gesture detection**, optimizing both accuracy and processing speed.
- The system processes video input frames, detects hand landmarks, and classifies them into meaningful signs.

## 🔧 Technologies & Tools Used
- **Python**
- **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)**
- **OpenCV**
- **MediaPipe**
- **NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📈 Key Highlights
- Real-time gesture recognition with high precision and responsiveness.
- Robust dataset preprocessing and model training pipeline.
- Enhanced system efficiency and low false-positive rate through landmark filtering and model tuning.

## 🎯 Objective
To develop an assistive tech solution that simplifies communication for the deaf and mute community by translating hand gestures into readable formats using machine learning and computer vision.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- Upgrade the model using **CNN or KNN for improved accuracy**.
- Include **voice output integration** using Text-to-Speech libraries.
- Expand the system to recognize **sentence-level gesture sequences**.
